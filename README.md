# Implementation of the Projected Variational Quantum Dynamics Algorithm

We implement the 
[projected Variational Quantum Dynamics algorithm](https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2021-07-28-512) 
for multiple coupled spins in a transverse uniform magnetic field using Pennylane.

We plan to test and study the fidelity (our cost function) at each time step, as well as Pauli spin 
observables and compare our results to the published outcomes.
